@article{levelt1992,
	Abstract = {This paper introduces a special issue of Cognition on lexical access in speech production. Over the last quarter century, the psycholinguistic study of speaking, and in particular of accessing words in speech, received a major new impetus from the analysis of speech errors, dysfluencies and hesitations, from aphasiology, and from new paradigms in reaction time research. The emerging theoretical picture partitions the accessing process into two subprocesses, the selection of an appropriate lexical item (a ``lemma'') from the mental lexicon, and the phonological encoding of that item, that is, the computation of a phonetic program for the item in the context of utterance. These two theoretical domains are successively introduced by outlining some core issues that have been or still have to be addressed. The final section discusses the controversial question whether phonological encoding can affect lexical selection. This partitioning is also followed in this special issue as a whole. There are, first, four papers on lexical selection, then three papers on phonological encoding, and finally one on the interaction between selection and phonological encoding. },

@article{eber1999,
	Abstract = {Four experiments investigated whether the conceptual number of a subject phrase can control verb agreement in English. Following a study by Bock and Miller (1991, Experiment 2), speakers provided sentence completions for grammatically singular subject phrases that referred to one referent (e.g., The trap for the rats) or to distributed copies of a referent (e.g., The stamp on the envelopes). The numbers of plural agreement errors produced in the completions were compared. Contrary to Bock and Miller's findings, significantly more errors were produced following the distributive-referent phrases. The results of two rating studies showed that the phrases used here were easier to imagine and therefore conceptually more accessible than the phrases used in Bock and Miller's study. Additional evidence for the role of conceptual accessibility came from a positive correlation between the phrases' imageability ratings and the number of agreement errors they elicited. The implications of these results for theoretical issues concerning the interaction between conceptual and grammatical encoding are discussed.},

 "If children view gestures as irrational movements,
they may think of gesture as movement for its own sake. If so, after
watching an adult produce a gesture for an action intended to be
performed on an object, a young child might respond by reproducing
the gesture itself (i.e., making a movement in the air), rather
than by acting on the object."
--Ok, but 1. children have no trouble at all in seeing gesture as intentional communicative act (diectic, emblematic gesture), nor do adults gesture for the sake of gesturing. 

If children in our study are able to
learn which action to perform on an object from watching an
incomplete-action demonstration (e.g., watching someone try,
but fail, to put a ring on a peg), but not from watching a comparable
gesture (e.g., watching someone gesture the movement that
would result in the ring being put on the peg), we will have evidence
that gleaning substantive information from gesture requires
skills that go beyond making an inference from an action that is not
completed.

In this article, we describe and evaluate the potential contributions of MTurk to psychology and other social sciences. Findings indicate that (a) MTurk participants are slightly more demographically diverse than are standard Internet samples and are significantly more diverse than typical American college samples; (b) participation is affected by compensation rate and task length, but participants can still be recruited rapidly and inexpensively; (c) realistic compensation rates do not affect data quality; and (d) the data obtained are at least as reliable as those obtained via traditional methods. Overall, MTurk can be used to obtain high-quality data inexpensively and rapidly.},

	Abstract = {To study the time course of sentence formulation, we monitored the eye movements of speakers as they described simple events. The similarity between speakers' initial eye movements and those of observers performing a nonverbal event-comprehension task suggested that response-relevant information was rapidly extracted from scenes, allowing speakers to select grammatical subjects based on comprehended events rather than salience. When speaking extemporaneously, speakers began fixating pictured elements less than a second before naming them within their descriptions, a finding consistent with incremental lexical encoding. Eye movements anticipated the order of mention despite changes in picture orientation, in who-did-what-to-whom, and in sentence structure. The results support Wundt's theory of sentence production.},

@article{kempenHo1987,
	Abstract = {This paper presents a theory of the syntactic aspects of human sentence production. An important characteristic of unprepared speech is that overt pronunciation of a sentence can be initiated before the speaker has completely worked out the meaning content he or she is going to express in that sentence. Apparently, the speaker is able to build up a syntactically coherent utterance out of a series of syntactic fragments each rendering a new part of the meaning content. This incremental, left-to-right mode of sentence production is the central capability of the proposed Incremental Procedural Grammar (IPG). Certain other properties of spontaneous speech, as derivable from speech errors, hesitations, self-repairs, and language pathology, are accounted for as well.The psychological plausibility thus gained by the grammar appears compatible with a satisfactory level of linguistic plausibility in that sentences receive structural descriptions which are in line with current theories of grammar. More importantly, an explanation for the existence of configurational conditions on transformations and other linguistics rules is proposed.The basic design feature of IPG which gives rise to these psychologically and linguistically desirable properties, is the ``Procedures + Stack'' concept. Sentences are built not by a central constructing agency which overlooks the whole process but by a team of syntactic procedures (modules) which work---in parallel---on small parts of the sentence, have only a limited overview, and whose sole communication channel is a stack.IPG covers object complement constructions, interrogatives, and word order in main and subordinate clauses. It handles unbounded dependencies, crossserial dependencies and coordination phenomena such as gapping and conjunction reduction. It is also capable of generating self-repairs and elliptical answers to questions. IPG has been implemented as an incremental Dutch sentence generator written in LISP.},

@article{ganush2014,
	Abstract = {This study investigated how sentence formulation is influenced by a preceding discourse context. In two eye-tracking experiments, participants described pictures of two-character transitive events in Dutch (Experiment 1) and Chinese (Experiment 2). Focus was manipulated by presenting questions before each picture. In the Neutral condition, participants first heard ``What is happening here?'' In the Object or Subject Focus conditions, the questions asked about the Object or Subject character (What is the policeman stopping? Who is stopping the truck?). The target response was the same in all conditions (The policeman is stopping the truck). In both experiments, sentence formulation in the Neutral condition showed the expected pattern of speakers fixating the subject character (policeman) before the object character (truck). In contrast, in the focus conditions speakers rapidly directed their gaze preferentially only to the character they needed to encode to answer the question (the new, or focused, character). The timing of gaze shifts to the new character varied by language group (Dutch vs. Chinese): shifts to the new character occurred earlier when information in the question can be repeated in the response with the same syntactic structure (in Chinese but not in Dutch). The results show that discourse affects the timecourse of linguistic formulation in simple sentences and that these effects can be modulated by language-specific linguistic structures such as parallels in the syntax of questions and declarative sentences.},

	Abstract = {The Battig and Montague (1969) category norms have been an invaluable tool for researchers in many fields, with a recent literature search revealing their use in over 1600 projects published in more than 200 different journals. Since 1969, numerous changes have occurred culturally that warrant the collection of new normative data. For instance, in the mid-1960s, the waltz was a popular dance, and undergraduates wore rubbers on their feet. To meet the need for updated norms, we report an expanded version of the Battig and Montague (1969) norms, based on responses from three different sites varying in geographical locations within the United States. The norms were expanded to include new categories (e.g., ad hoc categories) and new measures, most notably latencies for the generated responses. Analyses demonstrated high levels of geographical stability across the new sites, with lower and more variable levels of generational stability between the Battig and Montague norms and the current norms.},

In a production task, participants were given a verb and sentence preamble and asked to create a complete passive sentence. The preambles contained two nouns (e.g., the album by the classical composers). The plausibility of the verb was manipulated so that either (a) both nouns could be plausible passive subjects (e.g., praised, as both albums and composers can plausibly be praised) or (b) only the head noun could be a plausible subject (e.g., played, as only albums can plausibly be played). The comprehension task was self-paced reading with the same materials. The results from both methodologies demonstrated robust plausibility effects. There were higher agreement error rates in production and longer RTs at the verb in comprehension when both nouns were plausible subjects than when only the head was plausible. Implications for current production models are considered and an alternative account is presented that is motivated by current comprehension models and other recent production data.},

	Abstract = {Five experiments, using a subject--verb agreement error elicitation procedure, investigated syntactic planning processes in production. The experiments examined the influence of semantic integration---the degree to which phrases are tightly linked at the conceptual level---and contrasted two accounts of planning: serial stack-based systems and parallel activation-based systems. Serial stack-based systems rely on memory-shifting processes to coordinate ongoing planning. Memory-shifting should be easier for more integrated phrases, resulting in fewer errors. Parallel, activation-based systems, on the other hand, maintain multiple representations simultaneously in memory. More integrated phrases will be more likely to be processed together, resulting in increased interference and more errors. Participants completed stimuli like The drawing of/with the flower(s), which varied local noun number (flower(s)) and the relationship between the head (drawing) and local noun. In some constructions, the nouns were tightly integrated (e.g., of), whereas in others the relationship was looser (e.g., with, specifying accompaniment). In addition to the well-established local noun mismatch effect (more errors for plural than for singular local nouns), all experiments revealed larger mismatch error effects following tightly integrated stimuli. These results are compatible with parallel activation-based accounts and cannot be explained by serial, memory-shift-based accounts. The experiments and three meta-analyses also ruled out alternative accounts based on plausibility, argumenthood, conceptual number, clause packaging, or hierarchical feature-passing, reinforcing the general finding that error rates increase with degree of semantic integration.

	Abstract = {In this paper we address the question whether hierarchical relations and word order can be separated in sentence production. In two experiments, we assess whether subject-verb agreement errors (such as `The time for fun and games are over') require linear proximity of a so-called `local' noun (`games' in the example) to the verb. In the first experiment, we found a proximity effect when participants were asked to complete sentential beginnings of the kind: `The helicopter for the flights'. In the second experiment, we asked participants to produce a question such as `Is the helicopter for the flights safe?'. The syntactic relation between the subject noun and the local noun is the same in the two experiments, but the linear position of the local noun is different. The distribution of agreement errors was similar in the two experiments. We argue that these data provide evidence for a stage in language production in which a syntactic structure is built prior to a stage in which words are assigned to their linear position. Agreement is computed during the first stage.},

	Abstract = {According to certain theories of language production, lexical access to a content word consists of two independent and serially ordered stages. In the first, semantically driven stage, so-called lemmas are retrieved, i.e., lexical items that are specified with respect to syntactic and semantic properties, but not with respect to phonological characteristics. In the second stage, the corresponding wordforms, the so-called lexemes, are retrieved. This implies that the access to a content word involves an early stage of exclusively semantic activation and a later stage of exclusively phonological activation. This seriality assumption was tested experimentally, using a picture-word interference paradigm in which the interfering words were presented auditorily. The results show an interference effect of semantically related words on picture naming latencies at an early SOA (− 150 ms), and a facilitatory effect of phonologically related words at later SOAs (0 ms, + 150 ms). On the basis of these results it can be concluded that there is indeed a stage of lexical access to a content word where only its meaning is activated, followed by a stage where only its form is activated. These findings can be seen as empirical support for a two-stage model of lexical access, or, alternatively, as putting constraints on the parameters in a network model of lexical access, such as the model proposed by Dell and Reich.},

In a construction such as The pond near the trail(s) for the horse(s) was ¨, a linear account of subject-number tracking predicts greater interference from horses (N3), whereas a hierarchical account predicts greater interference from trails (N2). Experiment 1 used singular-head subject noun phrases (e.g., pond) and showed equal interference from N2 and N3, failing to differentiate between linear and hierarchical accounts. Experiment 2 used plural-head subjects and revealed more interference from N2 than N3. The pattern across the experiments accords with the ideas that (1) feature-tracking is hierarchical (e.g., Vigliocco & Nicol, 1997), (2) plurals are marked (e.g., Eberhard, 1997), and (3) subject-number information decays across intervening number-marked elements.},

	Abstract = {This chapter presents a discussion on lexical processing and sentence context effects during reading. There are various sources of information that are realized within the printed letter string of an individual word that might influence lexical access such as word familiarity, word class, and lexical ambiguity. Word frequency effects have been demonstrated in virtually every standard measure of word recognition, including lexical decision. Lexical familiarity (as assessed by printed word frequency), age of acquisition, or subjective familiarity rating influence a reader's initial processing time on a word as measured by first fixation duration or gaze duration. Readers spend more time on less familiar than on more familiar words of equal length. One way of investigating the role of word meaning in lexical access is to compare reading behavior on words that differ in the degree to which they convey semantic content. Lexically ambiguous words possess multiple meanings associated with a single orthographic form and, as such, they afford unique opportunities to examine the role of word meaning in lexical access. Under this view, given sufficiently constraining context, access may be limited to the context appropriate meaning of the ambiguous word.},

Attributes fitting the criteria for essential attributes were found to be judged more important than perceptual attributes in identifying an object and to have more connections to other attributes of the concept. Semantic priming for both types of features was then investigated. Prime-target pairs consisting of the natural kind concept term and the perceptual or essential attribute were presented for lexical decision (Experiments 1a and 1b) or naming (Experiments 2a and 2b).

functional relations showed greater priming, and essential and perceptual relations showed less. The average effect size for semantic priming was smaller than that for associative priming, suggesting that there is an "associative boost" from adding an associative relationship to a semantic one.

The theory of lexical access reviewed in this article covers a sequence of processing stages beginning with the speaker's focusing on a target concept and ending with the initiation of articulation. The initial stages of preparation are concerned with lexical selection, which is zooming in on the appropriate lexical item in the mental lexicon. The following stages concern form encoding, i.e., retrieving a word's morphemic phonological codes, syllabifying the word, and accessing the corresponding articulatory gestures. The theory is based on chronometric measurements of spoken word production, obtained, for instance, in picture-naming tasks. The theory is largely computationally implemented. It provides a handle on the analysis of multiword utterance production as well as a guide to the analysis and design of neuroimaging studies of spoken utterance production.},

Semantic relatedness had a large effect on the time to name a picture but not on the time to read a word aloud. The effect of relatedness was greater when the probability of a related pair was high, but this was not because of fast RTs for related targets but because of slow RTs for unrelated targets (a surprise effect). Frequency had a large effect on the time to name a picture and a significant but smaller effect on the time to read a word aloud. Semantic relatedness effects and frequency effects did not interact significantly. Findings suggest that in naming pictures, relatedness and frequency affect different processes and that relatedness affects primarily object recognition, whereas frequency affects primarily name retrieval.

In the present review, I critically examine the individual studies claiming evidence of featural and associative relations in semantic memory. The most important conclusion is that automatic priming appears to be due to both association strength and feature overlap. Mediated associates provide the strongest evidence of automatic associative priming, whereas functional associates, synonyms, and antonyms instead support priming based on feature overlap. In contrast, automatic priming does not occur for category coordinates or perceptually similar items, at least when presented in the visual modality. The status of other relations, such as collocates, episodic relatives, and script relations, is unclear and requires further experimentation. Implications for current models of semantic representation and priming are discussed.},

	Abstract = {Syntactic structure has been considered an integral component of agreement computation in language production. In agreement error studies, clause-boundedness (Bock & Cutting, 1992) and hierarchical feature-passing (Franck, Vigliocco, & Nicol, 2002) predict that local nouns within clausal modifiers should produce fewer errors than do those within phrasal modifiers due to structural differences; however, Gillespie and Pearlmutter (2011b) suggested structure might play a more limited role. Two studies examined whether the clause-boundedness effect would occur when prepositional phrase modifiers and relative clause modifiers were matched in properties likely to influence the timing of planning (Gillespie & Pearlmutter, 2011b; Solomon & Pearlmutter, 2004). In both studies, more errors occurred for plural local nouns, but the clause-boundedness effect was not observed. These findings suggest that agreement computation during production does not involve a hierarchical component. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved). (journal abstract)},

	Abstract = {Two subject--verb agreement error elicitation studies tested the hierarchical feature-passing account of agreement computation in production and three timing-based alternatives: linear distance to the head noun, semantic integration, and a combined effect of both (a scope of planning account). In Experiment 1, participants completed subject noun phrase (NP) stimuli consisting of a head NP followed by two prepositional phrase (PP) modifiers, where the first PP modified the first NP, and the second PP modified one of the two preceding NPs. Semantic integration between the head noun and the local noun within each PP was held constant across structures. The mismatch error pattern showed an effect of linear distance to the head noun and no influence of hierarchical distance. In Experiment 2, participants completed NP PP PP stimuli in which both PPs modified the head noun, and both the order of the two PPs and the local nouns' degree of semantic integration with the head noun were varied. The pattern of mismatch errors reflected a combination of semantic integration and linear distance to the head noun. These studies indicate that agreement processes are strongly constrained by grammatical-level scope of planning, with local nouns planned closer to the head having a greater chance of interfering with agreement computation.},

In English, the major agreement controller is the sentence subject, the major agreement targets are verbs and pronouns, and the major agreement category is number. The authors expand an account of number agreement whose tenets are that pronouns acquire number lexically, whereas verbs acquire it syntactically but with similar contributions from number meaning and from the number morphology of agreement controllers. These tenets were instantiated in a model using existing verb agreement data. The model was then fit to a new, more extensive set of verb data and tested with a parallel set of pronoun data. The theory was supported by the model's outcomes.

	Abstract = {English speakers distinguish between one entity and more than one entity in virtually every utterance they produce. The distinction is present in the morphology of most nouns as well as in the basic grammatical dependency of subject--verb agreement. Three experiments employing a sentence production task explored the nature of the representation that underlies singular and plural count nouns in English and how that representation interacts with the processes that implement agreement during production. The results provide evidence that singular count nouns are unmarked or lack a grammatical feature for number while plural count nouns are marked or possess a feature. This asymmetry in markedness contributes to the greater incidence of plural agreement errors relative to singular errors observed in naturally occurring and experimentally elicited errors. In particular, the evidence suggests that agreement with singular count nouns is implemented by a default process whereas agreement with plural count nouns is implemented on the basis of unambiguous number information.},

Shortly following the target verb onset, listeners looked at the recipient more (relative to the theme) following DO than PO primes, indicating that the structure of the prime affected listeners' eye gazes on the target scene. Crucially, this priming effect was the same irrespective of whether the postverbal nouns in the prime sentences did ("The monarch will send the painting to the president") or did not ("The monarch will send the envoy to the president") differ in animacy, suggesting that PO/DO priming in comprehension occurs because structural properties, rather than animacy features, are being primed when people process the ditransitive target verb.

To assess meaning-based (notional) versus form-based (morphological) control of number agreement, we examined how speakers created number agreement for collective nouns, which can carry conflicting notional and morphological number. The agreement targets were verbs and two types of pronouns, produced in the course of a sentence-completion task. Comparisons of the verbs and pronouns indicated that verbs tended to reflect the morphological number of the collective controller, whereas pronouns were more likely to reflect the notional number. This argues that the number features of pronouns may be retrieved under control from the speaker's meaning, while the number features of verbs are more likely to be retrieved under control from the utterance's form. The implication is that the retrieval of words during language production is influenced by two distinct types of information, consistent with an inflectional account of agreement.},

This superficially simple syntactic operation is regularly implemented by speakers, but occasionally derails in sentences such as The cost of the improvements have not yet been estimated . We examined whether the incidence of such errors was related to the presence of subject-like semantic features in the immediate preverbal nouns, in light of current questions about the semantic versus syntactic nature of sentence subjects and the interactivity of language processing. In three experiments, speakers completed sentence fragments designed to elicit erroneous agreement. We varied the number and animacy of the head noun and the immediate preverbal (local) noun, as well as the amount of material separating the head noun from the verb. The plurality of the local noun phrase had a large and reliable effect on the incidence of agreement errors, but neither its animacy nor its length affected their occurrence. The latter findings suggest, respectively, that the semantic features of sentence subjects are of minimal relevance to the syntactic and morphological processes that implement agreement, and that agreement features are specified at a point in processing where the eventual length of sentential constituents has little effect on syntactic planning. Both results follow naturally from explanations of language production that emphasize the segregation of sentence formulation processes into relatively autonomous components.},

	Abstract = {In English, words like scissors are grammatically plural but conceptually singular, while words like suds are both grammatically and conceptually plural. Words like army can be construed plurally, despite being grammatically singular. To explore whether and how congruence between grammatical and conceptual number affected the production of subject--verb number agreement in English, we elicited sentence completions for complex subject noun phrases like The advertisement for the scissors. In these phrases, singular subject nouns were followed by distractor words whose grammatical and conceptual numbers varied. The incidence of plural attraction (the use of plural verbs after plural distractors) increased only when distractors were grammatically plural, and revealed no influence from the distractors' number meanings. Companion experiments in Dutch offered converging support for this account and suggested that similar agreement processes operate in that language. The findings argue for a component of agreement that is sensitive primarily to the grammatical reflections of number. Together with other results, the evidence indicates that the implementation of agreement in languages like English and Dutch involves separable processes of number marking and number morphing, in which number meaning plays different parts.},

	Abstract = {Theories of sentence production based on speech errors divide lexical-syntactic integration processes into 2 components. The first involves formulating an abstract structural representation that includes semantically specified lexical items. The second involves placing phonologically specified content words into a syntactic frame whose configuration is determined by the initial structural representation. Syntactic form thus may be influenced directly by variations in the semantic processing of words, but not by variations in phonological processing. This hypothesis was tested and supported in 2 experiments with a total of 160 undergraduates who produced extemporaneous picture descriptions. Production of each description was preceded by the presentation of a priming word that was semantically or phonologically related to a target word likely to occur in the description. Semantically primed targets tended to appear as the Ss of active and passive sentences, whereas the same targets when they were not primed were more likely to appear as the objects. Phonological priming, although equal to semantic priming in ability to elicit the target words, was not reliably related to syntactic form.

The model's temporal properties resolve critical contradictions in the phonological processing literature. Its claims are further supported by a series of English-masking and English-priming experiments demonstrating that the contributions of consonants and vowels depend on target exposure duration and differ in their susceptibility to digit load. One methodological implication of the model is that regularity effects are not necessary evidence for assembly. This claim is supported by naming studies showing that vowel assembly requires long target durations, but short target durations permit consonant assembly despite null evidence for vowels.

	Abstract = {This paper examines the role of semantic factors in the production of subject--verb number agreement. As an ostensibly grammatical process, number agreement provides an interesting case for examining the flow and interaction of semantic and syntactic information through the language-production system. Using a sentence-completion task, agreement errors can be elicited from subjects by presenting them with sentence fragments containing a complex noun-phrase, in which the nonhead noun is plural (e.g., The key to the cabinets...WERE missing.). Previous research has demonstrated that the probability of making an error can be affected by varying the properties of the nouns in the complex noun phrase. By investigating which variables do and do not affect error rates, constraints on the flow of information through the production system can be inferred. In three experiments, we investigated the possible effects of three different semantic manipulations of the nouns in the complex NP: animacy, semantic overlap, and plausibility of modification by the sentence predicate. We found that both animacy and semantic relatedness had reliable effects on error rates, indicating that the mechanism involved in implementing agreement cannot be blind to semantic information. However, the plausibility with which each noun could serve as the subject of the sentence predicate had no effect on error rates. Taken together, these results suggest that while semantic information is visible to the agreement mechanism, there are still constraints on when this information can affect the process. Specifically, it may be the case that only information contained within the complex NP is considered for the purposes of implementing agreement.},

	Abstract = {Syntactic priming, a phenomenon that previous exposure to a particular syntactic structure makes the structure more accessible in subsequent utterances, has widely been observed in both language production and comprehension. Previous research using this paradigm revealed a great deal about processing and representations of syntactic structures. Based on previous findings, it is recently proposed that priming plays a central role in the language processing and learning system. Such a claim often presumes that syntactic priming occurs in the same way across languages. Increasing evidence demonstrates priming in many different languages but what is challenging is to establish that syntactic priming is underlain by the same mechanism across languages. Perhaps the strongest test of such a common mechanism account is to examine the phenomenon in languages that are typologically different from English and other Germanic languages on which the majority of previous studies were conducted. To address this issue, this article reviews the previous studies conducted in head-final languages. Finding that syntactic priming occurs in a similar way between head-final languages and head-initial languages would provide strong support to the common mechanism of priming across languages. Although evidence is still limited, previous studies support that syntactic priming occurs in head-final languages in a similar way and possibly by the same mechanism as in head-initial languages. I also discuss implications of the results of those studies for the syntactic representations and processing in head-final languages. },
